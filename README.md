## About

CampSights is a Python application that utilizes the <a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/">Recreation Information Database</a> API to find new places to camp and hike. If a suggestion seems appealing to a user, it can be saved to create an adventure 'to-do' list. Users can also use CampSights to log the sites they've visited to help keep track of the campgrounds they've already been to and would like to visit again.
